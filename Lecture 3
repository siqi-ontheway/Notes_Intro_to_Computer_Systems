Unsigned Addition Overflow
 - When it results in overflow, the additional carry digit is just simply ignored

Two's complement Addition Overflow
 - When it results in overflow, the additional carry digit is just simply ignored
 - Treat remaining bits as 2's complement integer.

Unsigned Multiplication Overflow

Signed Multiplication Overflow
 - When it results in overflow, the additional carry digit is just simply ignored
 - Low bits are the same
 - Treat remaining bits as 2's complement integer
 - Some of which are different for signed vs unsigned multiplication
 
 Power-of-2 Shift Multiply with Shift
  - u<<k gives u*2^k
  - both signed and unsigned
 
 Unsigned Power-of-2 Divide with Shift
  - u>>k gives u/2^k
  - uses logical shift (fill left by 0)>>> in java
  
 Byte-Oriented Memory Organization
  - Programs refer to data by address
  - System provides private address spaces to each process
  - Address specify the byte locations
    * Addresses of first byte in word
    * Address of successive byte differ by 4(32-bit) or 8(64-bit)
  Byte Order
  - Big Endian - order is easy to read
  - Little Endian - flip big endian
