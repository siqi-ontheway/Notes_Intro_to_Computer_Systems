Reality!
# Reality 1: Overflow
x*x > 0 ? For float- Yes! For int, probably not becasue of memory outage.
(X + Y) + Z == X + (Y +Z)? For float - probably not when X+Y == 0 && X,Y >>Z
# Reality 2: Assembly - key to machine-level execution
# Reality 3: Memory Matters
  Memory is not unbounded - it must be allocated and managed
  Random access memory is unphysical abstraction
  Memory performance is not uniform    for (i...for (j... d[i][j]  VS   for (j...for (i... d[i][j]
  Memory referencing bugs -   C/C++ language don't provide memory protection
 
# Reality 4: Computers communicate with others, not just executing programs.
